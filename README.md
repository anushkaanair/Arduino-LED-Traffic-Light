Working on Basics
The LED have been powered by Arduino UNO (Board). It contains a code which uploaded to the board. And once it simulated LED Start's blinking like a traffic light. In this 15 Second will for Red Light 6 Second for Yellow Light (In my Project Blue) and 20 Second for Green Light.

Usage
There is multiple usage of the project:- 
You can Make a real but small Traffic Light using it 
You can also add more LED and Can change as per your usgeg

Hookup Connections
Hook the GND pin (Negative Pin) of all led to Pin GND of Arduino. 
Connect Red LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin) to Pin 9 of Arduino. 
Connect Yellow LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin) to Pin 8 of Arduino. 
Connect Green LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin) to Pin 7 of Arduino. 
Uploading and Testing
Copy or download the code attached with the project.
